## Prerequisites
  * Install Nautilus Wallet on your computer [download here]
  * Create a wallet/account in Nautilus.  
  * Deposit 20000 Pirl (plus a little extra) in the Nautilus Wallet address
    * (a little extra pirl is needed to process 1 transaction.  1 or 2 extra Pirl is adequate)
  * A dedicated server of VPS with Linux operating system, 4GB memory, 20GB disk, 3TB data trasnfer, public IP address.
    * Make sure that the IP address can be bound to the server.  Some virtual private server providers do not permit this.
  * Create an account at Pirl Poseidon (use a strong password).
  
  ## Step 1: Create an Identifying Transaction for Your Nautilus (Collateral) Address
    * It is necessary to send a transaction from your Nautilus (Collatoral) address to the Poseidon wallet address.
    * Login to POseidon.  On the left hand menu, choose Wallet --> Wallet Details. YOu will see a wallet address.  Copy this address.  
    * Go to the Nautilus wallet and send a transaction from the Nautiuls (Collateral) wallet address to the Poeidon address.  Any amount will be sufficient (0.5 pirl).
     * IMPORTANT:  DO NOT SEND YOUR 20,000 PIRL TO THE POSEIDON ADDRESS.  
     * IMPORTANT:  DO NOT USE AN EXCTHANGE ADDRESS AS YOUR COLLATERAL ADDRESS.
